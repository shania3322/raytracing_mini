# leaning C++ via writing a simple Ray Tracer

# Learning Materials
Ray Tracing in One Weekend [online book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

# Objective
1. Being able to program in c++ comfortably at the end of the course
2. Understand how Ray Tracing works and able to explain it in simple words
3. Logging daily progress and the weekly object
4. What's next?
